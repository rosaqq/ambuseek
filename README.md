# AmbuSeek™ playground
(™ is a joke)

This is a second take at the 2025 SciTech Hackathon challenge!  
Got the motivation after playing with [this code](https://github.com/CokieMiner/SciTech/) by @CokieMiner and reading a bit about the [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)  

- Weighted graph of Hospitals and Patients.
- Each patient had a score and an immediate care time.
- An ambulance must go pick them up, provide immediate care, and bring them to a hospital.
- Goal was to maximize total score of treated patients for a given input "run time".

And extra points for UI/UX with a visualizer for our ambulance.  

Note that current code is a patchwork of heavy ChatGPT snippets and has a lot of dumb in it.  
But the general idea is there :)
